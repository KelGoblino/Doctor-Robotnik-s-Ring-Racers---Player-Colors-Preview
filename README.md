# <b>Dr. Robotnik's Ring Racers Colors Preview</b>

An edit of [SRB2Kart (v1) Colours Preview](https://github.com/Koolwad/srb2kart-colours-preview) to be compatible with the palette and skincolors used in Dr. Robotnik's Ring Racers.

The full list of skincolors can be found [here](https://imgur.com/XxutE72). Credits to Axecrusader and FrivilousAqua for making the graphic!

# Installing the Script

Open Aseprite and open your <b>scripts</b> folder; <code>File ⟶ Scripts ⟶ Open Scripts Folder</code> 

From there, paste the script inside and rescan your folder so Aseprite detects it, either by pressing <code>F5</code> or <code>File ⟶ Scripts ⟶ Rescan Scripts Folder</code>. You should now see <code>drrr-colours-preview</code> as a script.

# Instructions

This script functions identically to the script made for Srb2Kart.

Select an area of your sprite you wish to have recolored, then use the included .pal file to process your sprite into the game's skincolors!

This script can also process an entire sprite sheet, with some prerequisites:

* The sprite has to be in <b>Indexed</b> mode. If not, you can change it via <code>Sprite ⟶ Color Mode ⟶ Indexed</code>.
* The palette has to already be imported; you can use the same <code>rrpal.pal</code> file for this as well.
